# CodeMuse 🚀

AI-powered code documentation tool that generates professional docstrings and learns your coding style.

## ✨ Features

- **🤖 AI-Powered Documentation** - Generates comprehensive docstrings using state-of-the-art models
- **🎨 Style Learning** - Adapts to your writing style from edits
- **🖱️ Drag & Drop Interface** - Simple Qt-based GUI for easy file handling
- **⚡ Hardware Adaptive** - Automatically selects optimal model for your GPU/CPU
- **🔍 AST-Powered Analysis** - Deep code understanding through abstract syntax trees
- **📝 Real-Time Editing** - Review and refine AI-generated comments

## New Feature: Personalized Style Transfer

**Adapt comments to your style**:

The app now learns from your edits and fine-tunes a local model to generate docstrings in your personal writing style.

**How it works**:

- Your edits to generated comments are stored locally in a SQLite database.

- Once enough examples are collected, the system fine-tunes a local model to reflect your style.

- Embeddings of code are clustered to provide context-aware style adaptation, so comments match the type of code being documented.

**Fully offline**: No API calls or cloud services are required—your code and style data stay local
